# ImmaOnStudio

We present to you, ImmaOnStudio! ImmaOnStudio is a website where you can reserve SMK Immanuel Pontianak's Studio. We have just developed this website project for about 1 month. In this process, we want to create ImmaOnStudio as a website used for reserving studio effortlessly and effectively through the internet. Let alone, teachers (with admin role) also have the access to a dashboard to monitor and know the studio usages.
